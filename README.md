An Android application which utilizes Kotlin, Retrofit, Gson, Google Maps and Places API to show the nearest coffee shops

1.  Clone repo
2.  Open in Android Studio
3.  It will use the latest Kotlin version, and some other libs like Retrofit, Mockito
4.  You should be able to press the run button at the top and either run the application on a connected Android device or run it on an emulator that you have setup within Android Studio.

I ran through Google's query limit pretty fast on the API and got locked out from doing more testing for a day or two as a result.
Hopefully I got enough testing in beforehand :)

I structured the project in a MVC fashion, with modules for View, Controllers, and Models.  There is also a networking module which makes use of third party lib Retrofit and Gson.
